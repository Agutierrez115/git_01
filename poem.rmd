ChatGPT
In a haze of green, I softly float,   
Where time dissolves, and worries demote.   
Eyes glazed over, mind takes flight,   
In the realm of dreams, I find delight.   

Senses alive, colors dance and sing,   
Every giggle, a bell's sweet ring.   
Munchies beckon, flavors divine,   
Journeying through tastes, a feast in line.   

Gravityâ€™s grip, a gentle caress,   
Weightless whispers, in a state of bless.   
Thoughts unravel, in a cosmic stream,   
Lost in the stars, in a mind's dream.   

Giggles erupt, laughter takes flight,   
In this euphoria, everything's bright.   
Time stretches out, in a slow parade,   
Moments linger, in a serenade.   

Reality bends, in a gentle sway,   
In this altered state, I blissfully stay.   
Weed's embrace, a tranquil sea,   
In its gentle waves, I am free.
